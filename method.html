            <p>
              For this project, the dataset that is used is a second-source data
              the data are collected by other organization and not myself. The
              dataset that is extracted can be found at oecd.org where the dataset
              is related to Non-medical determinants of health.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dataset is downloaded in a comma separated value (csv) file because
              it is easier to process the data in that format. The file contains many
              data including variable, measure, country code, country name, year, value and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
              After going though some consideration and thoughts, only a certain number of
              columns will be selected to be analysed. The most important data would be
              the alcohol consumption measures, the year it is recorded and the country it is
              associated with. In addition, I have derived a new column to store the
              continent that the country is in. This is because the countries can
              be grouped into continents.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the alcohol consumption will be recorded as a numerical data,
              year as an ordinal data, while country and continent as a categorical data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a screenshot of a part of the full dataset that is used from
              the internet

            <span class="card-title blue-text text-darken-2">Data Processing Stage</span>
            <p>
              In order to filter out all the data that is not relevent and useful
              for the data visualisation, I have created a script of python to
              generate all the datasets that I need. I have used the pandas library
              to assist me in creating dataset
            </p>
            <p>
              The final format of the datasets is in a comma separated value (csv)
              file because it would be more easier for data visualisation using D3.
            </p>
            <p>
              From all the data from the original dataset, I have classified the data
              on alcohol consumption into many groups based on countries, continents
              and also year range. This is to ensure the dataset are classified
              and grouped, making it easier for data analysing to find correlations
              and patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Included here is an excerpt from the python script as an example
            </p>

            <p>
              At this stage, since all the datasets that are needed are generated,
              the visualisation can be made. In this project, the tool that is used
              to create visualisations is D3.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              Considerations and selections are made to use the most suitable
              graph for each dataset. This is an essential part to ensure the data
              are being represented correctly and to avoid misconception.
            </p>
            <p>
              The encoding and other factors such as hue, filtering and many more
              are discussed in the project book. The chart that is displayed intially
              are the data from 1990 and the user will be able to see data on-demand
              and filter the data based on continents.

            <ul class="circle">
              <li>Russia has the most litres of Alcohol Consumption per capita for citizens aged 15 and above since 1990 but the litres of alchol consumption has decreased over the years</li>
              <li>United States is the country with the most alcohol consumption per capita for citizens aged 15 and above in the America continent since 1990</li>
              <li>Lithuania who ranked 17th in Europe in 1990 for alcohol consumption per capita for citizens aged 15 and above has increased to the first rank in the 2006-2015 period</li>
              <li>Australia is the only country from the Asia/Oceania continent to be ranked among other European countries in the top 50% of the list since 1990</li>
